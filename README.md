PSY6009: Dissertation Project Assignment - Do cognition-related beliefs relate to cognitive skills and plasticity?

ABSTRACT
Background. Literature exploring the effectiveness of cognitive training procedures for enhancing cognitive skill have consistently attributed variation in training and transfer effects to age-related differences and baseline performance. Following suggestions to investigate other sources of individual difference (Katz et al., 2021), one’s cognition-related beliefs – including their grit (Duckworth et al., 2007), self-efficacy (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995) and mindset (Dweck, 1999) – have shown absent or inconsistent relationships with cognitive skill improvement. Data from a larger project (von Bastian et al., 2022b) is viable to explore whether cognition-related beliefs can predict training and transfer effects in various cognitive abilities following processing speed training.

Method. Using a longitudinal multi-site design, participants of varying ages (18-85 years) completed various cognitive tasks measuring processing speed, working memory, and reasoning; before, immediately after, and three months following varyingly demanding processing speed training. Their grit, mindset and self-efficacy were intended to predict their baseline ability and changes in ability between time-points, however Latent Growth Curve Models (LGCMs) were unsuccessful. Linear Mixed effects Models (LMEMs) were used to regress beliefs on skill at each time-point instead.

Results. Effects of cognition-related beliefs were mostly non-significant, with minor effects occurring inconsistently across training groups, cognitive skills and time-points. The benefits of lower age, higher baseline performance, and relevant training were more substantial across all skills and time-points. Notably, above-average grit could variably predict below and above-average performance, which highlighted the unreliability of skill prediction using beliefs.

Discussion. Findings conformed with studies recognising positive, negative and absent effects of cognition-related beliefs, overall indicating an unreliable relationship between cognition-related beliefs and skills and plasticity. Rather than using cross-sectional measurements of belief, re-analysis could investigate whether intra-individual change in beliefs corresponded with intra-individual changes in ability (Otsuka & Miyatani, 2020). Re-estimation of reaction-time LGCMs using drift rate could also rectify modelling issues.
